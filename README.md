# CALCULATOR | WEBSITE TEMPLATE

A website that I made in my free time, made for open source, with this code you can learn the content of the calculators and the functions that the code has.

It contains on/off system, “=”, “+”, “-” buttons and more, you can use it as a code base and make your own systems, fix them and improve them.

Made with love by GhostCode for the community, open source, clean code, working code.
